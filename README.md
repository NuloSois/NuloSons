# SoundRepository
### Repository for my music indexing site and for HTML/CSS/JS Learning and Archiving Purposes

### [Github Pages Link](https://nulosois.github.io/SoundRepository/index.html)

It's just if someone wants to recreate some cool effect they found in the site.

I'm using it as my testbed for beggining Front-End Learning so forgive-me if it's a little rough, things will get better.
