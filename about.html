         This site was mainly created for 2 things: Index my music in a repository & Learn web development.


         You can judge my success in this mission by just browsing the site, it's all evident ― in fact ―<br>
         the source code of the site is public and acessible <A href="https://github.com/NuloSois/SoundRepository">Here</A>.<br>

        Hello, my name is Davi, I'm a brazilian Musician, Developer and a lot of other things unrelated to this site.

        I've been playing Guitar and Composing since January 2020, having started taking formal lessons with more rigor<br>
        since April 2022, along with Keyboard classes. My main musical interests are: Rock/Metal (and their subgenres),<br>
        Electronic, Classical (mainly from the romantic and modern periods and MPB/Bossa Nova, among other genres.<br>
        Music is one of the passions pf my life and one of the thing I live for, so I may get too passionate about the topic from<br>
        time to time.<br>

        I have released two LPs since 2020, one of which I'm not proud to share, the other, differently, Is Nu Mun, which<br>
        is indexed in the site. I also have lots of still unreleased music, be it in production or finished, ranging from<br>
        Classical Compositions to Guitar Demos.
        </p>

        <p class = "Ltex">
        Now a List of gear I use for my music:
        <li class = "Ltex">Guitar: Modified Tagima Guitar (Probably a Stella or a TG-510).</li>
        <li class = "Ltex">Amp: Frahm CA-909.</li>
        <li class = "Ltex">DAW: FL Studio 12.</li>
        <li class = "Ltex">Mic: Unprofessional.</li>
        <li class = "Ltex">ScoreWriter: Musescore 3.</li>
        <li class = "Ltex">Video Editor: VEGAS Pro 18.</li>   
        </p>

        <p class = "Ltex">
        As much I enjoy making music, I also very much enjoy listening and analyzing the music of others, for that reason<br> 
        I also intend to have a Section for Reviews, Playlists and Recomendations in this site. This is improtant not only<br>
        for the sake of sharing great music but also for drawing the map of influences and interests of me as a musician.
